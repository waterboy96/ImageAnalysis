# Image Analysis Repository

This repository contains work related to a recently submitted abstract for the ECO-STP conference. 
The following jupyter notebook contains an example on generating feature vectors from a computer vision model, dimensionality reduction with PCA, cluster them with K-means clustering, and visualize the obtained clusters.

To try it out you can open and run the notebook in colab:
